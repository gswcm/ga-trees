<a name=3></a><b>FOREWARD</b><br/>
This manual has been prepared in an effort to give to those<br/>
interested in the trees of Georgia a means by which they may<br/>gain a more intimate knowledge of the tree species. Of about<br/>250 species native to the state, only 92 are described here.<br/>These were chosen for their commercial importance,<br/>distribution over the state or because of some unusual<br/>characteristic.<br/>
Since the manual is intended primarily for the use of the<br/>
layman, technical terms have been omitted wherever possible;<br/>however, the scientific names of the trees and the families to<br/>which they belong, have been included. It might be explained<br/>that the species are grouped by families, the name of each<br/>occurring at the top of the page over the name of the first<br/>member of that family.&#160;Also, there is included in the text, a<br/>subdivision entitled KEY CHARACTERISTICS, the purpose of<br/>which is to give the reader, all in one group, the most<br/>outstanding features whereby he may more easily recognize<br/>the tree.<br/>
<b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b><br/>
The author wishes to express his appreciation to the<br/>
Houghton Mifflin Company, publishers of Sargent’s&#160;<i>Manual of<br/>the Trees of North&#160;America</i>, for permission to use the cuts of<br/>all trees appearing in this manual; to B. R. Stogsdill for<br/>assistance in arranging the material; to W.&#160;C. Hammerle, &#160;Acting<br/>Director of the State Division of Forestry, and to many others<br/>for helpful suggestions and criticisms.<br/>
Of much assistance in the preparation of the manual was<br/>
the information contained in several text and manuals, among<br/>which were:&#160;<i>Manual of the Trees of North&#160;America</i>&#160;by C. S.<br/>Sargent;&#160;&#160;<i>Trees of the Southeastern States</i>&#160;by Coker and<br/>Totten;&#160;&#160;<i>Textbook of Dendrology</i>&#160;by Harlow and Harrar.<br/>
In the Third Edition both common and scientific names were<br/>
changed to conform to the&#160;<i>Check List of Native and Naturalized<br/>Trees of the United States (including&#160;Alaska</i>),&#160;&#160;<i>Agriculture<br/>Handbook No.41</i>, Forest Service, U.S. Department of<br/>Agriculture, 1953. Two exceptions to the above are:&#160;<i>Carya<br/>carolinae-septentrionalis</i>&#160;(Ashe) Engelm. &amp; Graebn., and<br/><i>Carya ovalis</i>&#160;(Wangenh.) Sarg.<br/>

<a name=8></a><img src="NativeTreesGeorgia-8_1.png"/><br/>
SLASH &#160;PINE<br/>
<i>&#160;(Pinus elliottii&#160;</i>Engelm.)<br/>
DESCRIPTION:&#160;<b>Leaves</b>&#160;or needles 8 to 12 inches long, in<br/>clusters of 2, or more often, 3 to the sheath; dark green and<br/>thickly set on the branch.&#160;<b>Fruit</b>&#160;or cone 3 to 6 inches long,<br/>brown at maturity and glossy. Scales armed with minute<br/>prickles.&#160;<b>Bark</b>&#160;rough and dark reddish brown on young trees<br/>and becoming orange-brown and broken into broad, flat<br/>scales on old trees.&#160;A&#160;<b>tree</b>&#160;often 80 to 100 feet in height with<br/>a tall tapering trunk 2 to 3 feet in diameter, terminating in a<br/>handsome, round-topped head.<br/>
KEY CHARACTERISTICS: Leaves or needles 8 to 12 inches<br/>long in clusters of 2 to 3 to the sheath; cones 3 to 6 inches<br/>long, brown, glossy.<br/>
WOOD: Heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained, rich, dark<br/>orange-colored heartwood and white sapwood, durable<br/>heartwood.<br/>
USES: Railroad ties, general construction, poles and piling,<br/>boats, railroad cars, pulp, and many other uses: also one of<br/>the two species which produce gum turpentine and rosin.<br/>
&#160;DISTRIBUTION: Confined principally to the lower coastal plain,<br/>the chief habitat being low, moist, sandy sites, however often<br/>thriving on the drier ridges common to its range. Common in<br/>plantations.<br/>

<a name=9></a><img src="NativeTreesGeorgia-9_1.png"/><br/>
LOBLOLLY&#160; PINE<br/>
<i>&#160;(Pinus taeda&#160;</i>L.)<br/>
DESCRIPTION:&#160;<b>Leaves</b>&#160;or needles 6 to 9 inches long, slightly<br/>twisted, pale blue-green and occurring in clusters of 3 to the<br/>sheath.&#160;<b>Fruit</b>&#160;or cone 2 to 6 inches long, light reddish brown<br/>at maturity; scales armed with short, stout prickles.&#160;<b>Bark</b>&#160;on<br/>young trees dark in color and deeply furrowed, becoming on<br/>old trees bright red-brown and divided into broad, flat ridges.<br/>A&#160;<b>tree</b>&#160;100 feet in height&#160;with a trunk 2 to 5 feet in diameter.<br/>Perhaps the fastest growing southern pine.<br/>
KEY CHARACTERISTICS: Leaves or needles pale blue-green,<br/>occurring in clusters of 3 to the sheath, grouped near the<br/>ends of the branch; bark on young trees dark, reddish brown<br/>or nearly black; cone scales armed with short, stout prickles.<br/>
WOOD: Light brown heartwood with orange-colored to white<br/>sapwood. Mixed with slash, longleaf, shortleaf, and sold in<br/>the lumber trade as southern yellow pine.<br/>
USES: In general similar to those of the other southern pines,<br/>being used in construction, interior and exterior finish, pulp,<br/>etc.<br/>
DISTRIBUTION: &#160;Found generally throughout the state with the<br/>exception of the higher mountains. Less plentiful in the coastal<br/>plain than in the piedmont where it occurs in great abundance.<br/>Most common of the southern yellow pines and often in<br/>plantations.<br/>

SHORTLEAF PINE<br/>
<i>&#160;(Pinus echinata&#160;</i>Mill.)<br/>
DESCRIPTION:&#160;<b>Leaves</b>&#160;or needles 3 to 5 inches long, dark<br/>yellow-green, and occurring in clusters of 2 to 3 to the sheath.<br/><b>Fruit</b>&#160;or cone 1 1/2 to 2 1/2&#160;inches long becoming dull brown<br/>at maturity; scales armed with short, sometimes deciduous,<br/>prickles.&#160;<b>Bark</b>&#160;broken into irregular plates covered with small,<br/>light cinnamon-red scales.&#160;A&#160;<b>tree</b>&#160;80 to 100 feet high with a<br/>trunk 3 to 4 feet in diameter, terminating in a short, pyramidal<br/>head of slender branches.<br/>
KEY CHARACTERISTICS: Leaves or needles 3 to 5 inches<br/>long, in clusters of 2 to 3 to the sheath; cone 1 1/2 to 2&#160;1/2<br/>inches long; scales armed with short, sometimes deciduous<br/>prickles.<br/>
WOOD: Variable, heavy, hard, strong, usually coarse-grained,<br/>orange-colored heartwood with cream-colored sapwood.<br/>
USES: Similar to those of the other southern pines, being<br/>used for construction, interior finish, pulp, etc.<br/>
DISTRIBUTION: Occurs throughout the state with the exception<br/>of a few isolated areas in the coastal plain. Perhaps more<br/>abundant on heavy clay soils in the upper piedmont.<br/>

VIRGINIA &#160;PINE<br/>
<i>(Pinus virginiana&#160;</i>Mill.)<br/>
DESCRIPTION<b>: Leaves</b>&#160;or needles 1 1/2 to 3 inches long,<br/>gray-green, occurring in bundles of 2 to the sheath.&#160;<b>Fruit<br/></b>or cone 1&#160;1/2&#160;to&#160;2&#160;1/2 inches long, slightly slender, slightly<br/>curved, dark red-brown and slightly glossy; the flat scales<br/>armed with short, often stout, prickles.&#160;<b>Bark</b>&#160;on young<br/>branches and upper trunk scaly but nearly smooth, becoming<br/>somewhat roughened on older trunks; reddish brown in color.<br/>A&#160;<b>tree</b>&#160;usually not more than 30 to 40 feet high with short<br/>trunk seldom exceeding 18 inches in diameter, terminating in a<br/>pyramidal head, the branches of which occur in remote<br/>whorls.<br/>
KEY CHARACTERISTICS: Leaves or needles shorter than<br/>any other native pine; bark almost smooth on upper trunk and<br/>branches; dead branches persistent for many years.<br/>
WOOD: Knotty, brittle, coarse-grained, fairly durable, light<br/>orange-colored heartwood with nearly white sapwood.<br/>Weaker than loblolly or shortleaf.<br/>
USES: Pulp, and occasionally manufactured into lumber which<br/>is graded separately from other southern yellow pines.<br/>
DISTRIBUTION: Restricted to the mountains and upper<br/>piedmont; found as far south as Clarke and Columbia Counties.<br/>
