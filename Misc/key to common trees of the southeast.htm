<p><b>Keys to Common Trees of the Southeast</b></p>
<p>Cooperative Extension Service/The University of Georgia College of 
Agriculture/Athens</p>
<p>B-730</p>
<p>This key is designed to help you systematically identify common trees.&nbsp; 
Technical terms are kept to a minimum so anyone interested in identifying trees 
can easily use this booklet.&nbsp; A glossary and drawings are included to 
explain unfamiliar terms.</p>
<p>There are separate keys for &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;summer&quot; use.&nbsp; The &quot;winter&quot; key 
primarily uses twig characteristics.&nbsp; The &quot;summer&quot; key is based primarily 
upon leaf characteristics, but a stem sample is also needed. </p>
<p>Using a key is a lot like traveling down a road and deciding which fork you 
want to take.&nbsp; Begin by reading the two number 1's located at the left.&nbsp; 
Read both choices carefully.&nbsp; Then decide which choice most accurately 
describes the plant you want to identify.&nbsp; The number to the right of the 
choice refers you to the next set of decisions.&nbsp; Continue making choices 
and following the key until you arrive at the name of the plant.&nbsp; It is a 
good idea to check a tree identification book to confirm or refine the identity 
obtained from the key.&nbsp; There are many good books with pictures and 
descriptions of various trees.</p>
<p>An attempt has been made to include common genera of trees, both native and 
naturalized, a beginner might encounter.&nbsp; Both common and scientific names 
are used.&nbsp; Scientific names are in bold type. An example of a scientific 
name is <b>Liquidambar styraciflua</b> used for sweetgum.&nbsp; <b>Liquidambar</b> 
is the genus (plural, genera).&nbsp; <b>Styraciflua</b> is the species name.&nbsp; 
If a genus has two or more species in our area, we have not listed the species 
name.&nbsp; If a genus only has one species in our area, we have included the 
species name. </p>
<p>Common names often vary from one locality to another.&nbsp; For many species, 
several common names have been included.&nbsp; A few of the genera included are 
shrubs which sometimes become tree-like.</p>
<p><b>Glossary of Terms in Key</b></p>
